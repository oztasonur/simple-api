# Custom Authentication Experiments - ARCHIVED

This branch contains my learning experiments with custom Spring Security authentication implementation.

## What's in this branch:
- Custom session-based authentication
- Manual session management 
- BCrypt password hashing
- Custom UserRepository and UserController
- User entity with security annotations
- Authentication endpoints and test controllers

## Status: ARCHIVED
**Archived on:** June 02, 2025  
**Reason:** Switching to default Spring Security approach for better security practices

## Current approach:
See `main` branch for the current implementation using Spring Security defaults.

## Learning value:
This branch preserves my learning journey and experiments for future reference. While these implementations work, I decided to use Spring Security's built-in features for better security and maintainability.
